    <p>Korean BBQ is a lively dining experience where diners grill marinated meats like beef short ribs and pork belly at the table. Known for bold flavors like soy, garlic, and sesame, it’s served with side dishes, or "banchan," including kimchi and pickled radishes. Each bite can be wrapped in lettuce with rice and sauce, making for a flavorful, interactive meal that highlights the richness of Korean cuisine.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds beef short ribs, cut flanken style</li>
        <li>1 Asian pear, cored and cubed</li>
        <li>1 onion, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup soy sauce (such as Kikkoman®)</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>¼ cup sesame oil</li>
        <li>black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ribs in a large pot and cover with cold water. Soak ribs in the refrigerator for 1 hour to pull out any blood. Drain.</li>
        <li>Combine Asian pear, onion, and garlic in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour into a large bowl and stir in soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, sesame oil, and black pepper. Add ribs to soy mixture; turn to coat evenly. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove ribs from marinade and cook on the preheated grill until meat is tender and the outside is crusty, 5 to 10 minutes per side. Discard marinade.</li>
    </ol>
